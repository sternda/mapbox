The basemap I created was influenced by nature. I wanted to make a basemap that people could use when exploring new territory, discovering new places to camp and hike, and how to get to these places. Features I wanted to accentuate were national parks, lakes and streams, and road networks. The background and national parks use earthy tones, while water features use a shade of blue reminiscent of a clear sky. I used bright yellow for road networks because it really made them pop and look like lightning travelling along the landscape. This lightning analogy works well because the road networks will be the paths of least resistance to any of the parks people want to visit.
